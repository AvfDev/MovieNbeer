# MovieNbeer is a little project about what Movies are on Theather. 
 The main idea is that you can see which movies are running on theathers on present week, the idea was to make in kotlin but I was not
 proficient enough in Kotlin to even make it to the 50%. Hope you can point some suggestion to make it better or that it can be useful to 
 someone. Movies are obtained from Themoviedb.org API.
